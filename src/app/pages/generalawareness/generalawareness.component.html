    <h2>Preventative measures:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Schedule regular checkups:</strong> Annual checkups with your
        doctor help identify potential health concerns early, when they're often
        easier to treat.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Maintain a healthy diet:</strong> Focus on fruits, vegetables,
        whole grains, and lean protein while limiting processed foods, sugary
        drinks, and excessive saturated and unhealthy fats.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Get regular exercise:</strong> Aim for at least 150 minutes of
        moderate-intensity exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise
        per week. Even small amounts of daily movement benefit your health.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Manage stress:</strong> Find healthy ways to manage stress, such
        as yoga, meditation, spending time in nature, or connecting with loved
        ones.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Get enough sleep:</strong> Aim for 7-8 hours of quality sleep
        each night for optimal physical and mental health.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Practice good hygiene:</strong> Wash your hands frequently,
        avoid close contact with sick people, and cover your mouth and nose when
        coughing or sneezing to prevent the spread of germs.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Stay up-to-date on immunizations:</strong> Follow recommended
        immunization schedules based on your age and health conditions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Don't ignore symptoms:</strong> Pay attention to changes in your
        body and see a doctor if you experience persistent or concerning
        symptoms.
      </li>
    </ul>

      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Engage in brain-stimulating activities:</strong> Read, solve
